        Although like many, one weakness I acknowledge is not valuing myself highly and this is something I routinely
        work on improving. Regardless of weakness, some of my strengths include: Impeccable timing. Now I don't mean I'm
        super punctual, nothing like that.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I mean is no matter how much effort I put in, I'm always in place need to be. I express myself through
        movement and making others laugh.

        Domestication is the key to success in life. So I played along with the rules and made a few mistakes.
        I'm not a perfectionist, but I'm a perfectionist.
        So much so i've wanted this page to be a perfect it never saw the digital light of day.
        Maybe i had to live life first before i could write this, who knows.
        But i'm proud of what i've done &amp; where i've been.
        Learning is life, and learning is fun.

        I can cook, and I love it.
        I love it so much that I'm always trying to learn new things.
        Although my cook style is somewhat orthodox and not very creative, I feel my fundamentals are strong.
        Hehe I love cooking.

        The 2 years I worked as a waiter at a local restaurant, I was able to learn a lot about the business.
        I also learnt how to be a good person (and not a bad one).
        i picked up a lot of skills in the process.
        I made a lot of tips hehe.
